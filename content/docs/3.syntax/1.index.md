title: Syntax
description: Create special hosts files.
---

Using a special syntax you create hosts files that embed dynamically other Hedit files and remote URLs. Those are compiled to a final valid hosts file when saved & activated.

Use the syntax in any Hedit file.

Supported syntax:
- [`@local`](/docs/syntax/local)
- [`@remote`](/docs/syntax/remote)

::warning
Be careful using the special syntax in "remote files", if the auto syncronization is enabled it will override your changes.
