When Hedit is running, you can enable remote hosts files to update automatically at regular intervals.

Set an interval in hours, starting at each hour (1).

::tip
Make sure to enable the application to run in background in [General](/docs/settings) for a better experience.

::warning
Any manual modification will be overwritten if the automatic synchronization is enabled.
