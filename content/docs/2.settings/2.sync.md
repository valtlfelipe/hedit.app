When Hedit is running, you can enable remote hosts to update automatically at regular intervals. This includes combo files as well.

Set an interval in hours, starting at each hour (1).

::tip
Make sure to enable the application to run in background in [General](/docs/settings) for a better experience.

::warning
Any manual modification will be overwritten if the automatic synchronization is enabled.
